🎯 Day 12: Number Guessing Game  

📄 Project Overview  
This project is a **Number Guessing Game** built using Python as part of my **100 Days of Code – Python** journey.  
The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts.

🎯 Objective  
- Practice functions and loops  
- Learn conditional logic  
- Handle user input effectively  
- Understand difficulty levels in a game  

✨ Features  
- Random number generation  
- Two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard  
- Limited number of attempts  
- Feedback for each guess (Too high / Too low)  
- Displays win or lose result  

🛠 Concepts Used  
- Functions  
- While Loop  
- If-Else Conditions  
- Random Module  
- User Input Handling
