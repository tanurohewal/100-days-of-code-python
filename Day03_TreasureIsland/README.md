# 🌴 Day 3 – Treasure Island

Welcome to **Treasure Island** – a fun **Choose Your Own Adventure** text-based game built in **Python**.  
Your mission is simple: **Find the hidden treasure!** 💎  

---

## 🏝️ How It Works

- The game starts with a storyline and asks you to make choices step by step.  
- Each choice you make decides your **fate** –  
  - Choose the right path → **Win the treasure** 🏆  
  - Choose the wrong path → **Game Over** ❌  

- The flow of the game is based on **nested if-else statements** and **string inputs** from the player.
