🎮 Day 7: Hangman Game  

📝 Project Overview  
This project is a **Hangman Game** created in Python as part of my 100 Days of Code journey.  
The player has to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Each wrong guess reduces a life, and the game ends when all lives are lost or the word is guessed correctly.  

🎯 Objective  
- Practice loops, conditionals, and string manipulation in Python.  
- Learn how to manage game states and user input.  
- Use external files (`hangman_art.py`, `hangman_words.py`) for better project structure.  

🕹 Features  
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.  
- ASCII art for the **hangman stages** and **logo** for a fun experience.  
- Tracks lives left and displays them after each guess.  
- Warns if a letter is already guessed.  
- Declares win if the word is guessed, or loss if lives reach zero.
