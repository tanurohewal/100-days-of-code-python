# Day 01 - Band Name Generator 🎵

This is my first project from the **100 Days of Code (Python)**course.  
It generates a fun band name by asking for the user's city and pet name.

## 🚀 Features
- Beginner-friendly Python project
- Takes user input for city and pet name
- Combines them to create a unique band name
- Great for practicing string concatenation and input handling

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Open your terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the following command:

Git Bash
python main.py
