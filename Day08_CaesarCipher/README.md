🔐 Day 8: Caesar Cipher  

📝 Project Overview  
This project is a **Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder** created in Python as part of my 100 Days of Code journey.  
It allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a chosen number.  

🎯 Objective  
- Understand how text-based encryption works using simple logic.  
- Practice Python concepts like loops, functions, and string manipulation.  
- Learn how to handle user input for encoding and decoding.  

🕹 Features  
- User chooses whether to **encode** (encrypt) or **decode** (decrypt).  
- Shift letters of the alphabet by any number.    
- Preserves non-alphabet symbols (e.g., spaces, numbers, punctuation).  
- Keeps shifting cyclic (wrap-around effect for `z → a`).
