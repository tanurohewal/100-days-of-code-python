# 🔐 Day 5: PyPassword Generator

## 🎮 Project Overview
This project is a **PyPassword Generator** created in Python as part of my 100 Days of Code journey.  
It generates a **secure and random password** using **letters, numbers, and symbols**, with the order **shuffled for maximum security**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to use **Python lists** and **loops** to handle multiple character sets.  
- Practice **`random` module functions** like `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`.  
- Understand **password generation logic** for security purposes.

---

## 🕹 Features
- User chooses:
  - Number of **letters** in the password  
  - Number of **symbols**  
  - Number of **numbers**  
- Password is generated with **random characters**.  
- **Shuffled order** ensures better security than simple sequential generation.  
- Outputs the **final secure password** to the console.
