☕ Day 15: Coffee Machine Program  

📄 Project Overview  
This project is a **Coffee Machine Simulation** built using Python as part of my **100 Days of Code – Python** journey.  
It mimics a real coffee machine that serves drinks, manages resources, processes coins, and tracks profit.

🎯 Objective  
- Build a real-world simulation using Python  
- Practice functions, loops, and conditionals  
- Manage resources using dictionaries  
- Implement transaction logic  

🛠 Concepts Used  
- Functions  
- Dictionaries  
- While Loop  
- If-Else Conditions  
- User Input Handling  
- Basic Financial Calculations  

⚙️ How It Works  
1. User selects a drink (espresso/latte/cappuccino)  
2. Machine checks if enough resources are available  
3. User inserts coins  
4. Machine verifies payment  
5. If payment is insufficient → refund issued  
6. If payment is excess → change returned  
7. Resources are deducted  
8. Drink is served with a message  
9. Machine continues for next customer
